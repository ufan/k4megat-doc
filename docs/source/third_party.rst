If you are a developer and interested in the details, here are the anatomy of the architecture of
of some core packages used by ``k4megat``.
They are based on my learning notes, and no guarantee that they are correct (since they are based
on my personal knowlegebase).

The official documentation and some published paper and talk should still be a developer's main reference
sources.
And the original source code is the final auditor.
